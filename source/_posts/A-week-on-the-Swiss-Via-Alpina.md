I spent a week walking the Via Alpina trail in Switzerland from late September to early October 2016. Cool thoughts are always bouncing around in my head when I hike for 8 hours straight and then lost to time when I leave the trail to rejoin society and go back to work/school. With neither of those responsibilities right now I can finally undertake this project and make a trip writeup \o/ Posts will be collected under the [Via Alpina](/blog/categories/via-alpina) category.

## some trail meta!

I'm on a fairly tight budgetâ€”10,000USD for the year. Even with cautionary tales of $20 McD from friends who visited earlier in the summer and as a personal witness/occasional participant to deeply luxurious San Francisco tech startup life I was shocked at how crazy Switzerland prices were. Luckily we brought all our food in from Germany, an excellent country with reasonable grocery bills and an appreciation for tasty dehydrated dinners (in the US you have to go to a sport store for that).

Hostel prices were ridiculous even by western european standards so we wild camped ("backcountry camping"). The trail was really developed and full of cows so we got pretty creative about finding places to sleep. And of course the trains ran smoothly and efficiently but were $$$ af. I found locals to be super nice and friendly towards hitchhiking!

I walked with tyler half the trip, and then continued on my own.

### resources

Here are some ways I prepared for the trip, because I sometimes get questions about how I plan/travel \o/

* [activity workshop .net](https://activityworkshop.net/hiking/alpinepassroute), an oddly-named website which provided kickass gps maps and elevation reliefs and info about the towns along the way.

* [OSM-AND](http://osmand.net/) and [Maps.me](http://maps.me/en/) android apps, which I used to read gps coordinates/trails from above. Both superior to google maps for (my style of) travel because of
  - excellent offline support
  - easy bookmarking/note-taking that exports to standard formats
  - you can search for bathrooms omg
  - more data for hiking trail/natural features (eg mountain peaks)  


* I also highly recommend the [OSM-AND topo plugin](http://osmand.net/features?id=contour-lines-plugin) for a super awesome hiking experience :D

* [Hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/) -- a wiki and map contributed by hitchhikers for hitchhikers!

* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), which I used to offline cache aforementioned resources.
