      Great post. Glad to hear you enjoyed SICP :) I've noticed this too,
      especially towards front-end as you say, also in general using "old" or
      "easy" tech like PHP or Python vs whatever FOTM deep neural network
      written in Rustlang on Kubernetnes or something. I see this a lot
      with vim/emacs too.

      It seems to me that it's relatively hard to gauge how "good" a software
      person so one identifier people use is various types of tech, especially
      those perceived as difficult to learn or abstract or niche. And then
      because no one can learn everything, most of these stereotypes are
      unfounded entirely.
      
      Possibly we're conflating "using difficult tech" with "being a good
      engineer"? Should we be asking people we meet, instead of what languages
      they know, what causes they're interested in or what they're trying to
      achieve with whatever tech they choose to use? I don't think this quite
      covers all the bases, some people like learning languages for the sake of
      learning them/the paradigm, but I think this could be a better way to
      learn about someone. Perhaps this doesn't really address your point of
      being respectful no matter what.

      Last thing that's slightly off-topic, have you been working on any cool
      new things in ClojureScript? I tried setting up figwheel a while ago but
      couldn't really figure it out...but reagent, garden, etc. look pretty
      cool, especially as a way to think about the DOM statelessly.

## I am exactly as cool as I was before I started writing clojure.

I've had a short, short life as a programmer and I've spent a lot of it making websites. Back in the day (as in a couple years ago) when I told other software people I'm a web developer, I got treated like shit. I was a lower class of coder because I wasn't "solving cool problems" because making web sites is easy. It was sad and confusing to receive unjustified hatred but I loved the internet and I thought it's pretty neat to make things that everyone can use and I like the visual component to my projects so I'd just go secretly cry in the bathroom (cool tricked I learned in college) like an ordinary functioning adult.

Somewhere along the way there was a massive rebranding so then I was doing literally the same things but now I'm a Frontend Engineer or UI Engineer. Occasionally I'd still get trashed by other coders but that's ok, I even get to sit with the other software folks sometimes!

I found web and design communities where people do good web things and encourage each other to be better. It's cool. Love is out there.

A month or two ago I started picking up clojure. I don't know why other people learn new programming languages, but I didn't know anything about clojure's rich history and I wasn't chasing the Beauty of Lisp or the superior mindset it would teach me or hoping to harness the performance or flexibility. I had no fucking clue about any of that. I'd just started reading [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp) because I missed computer science after bumping around in industryland, and it seemed trivial to swap scheme for clojure while doing the exercises in the book and end up being competent at a language I heard rumours that people use sometimes rather than a language I knew people used never.

And I liked it! It was my first lisp and yeah coming from javascript and python I liked the quaint syntax, and the way everything is all about these couple of data structures, and thinking functionally and non-mutably (word salad word salad). More significantly, I'd just left my previous job pretty much hating programming, and clojure was reminding me about why I like programming, and that was lovely. I noticed it was possible to use clojure to make UIs via clojurescript and figured it'd be a cool way to connect these two interests and go full circle.

I mentioned to some people I was learning clojure. Everyone was _super_ into this. People started telling me I was really cool. I noticed people making all these wildly positive assumptions about my programming ability despite not having read a single line of code I've written ever. I instantly get elevated to a respect-worthy status for free and maybe for people who are used to being treated well that's not a big deal, but coming from being treated like trash after telling people I am a web person the contrast was super intense and really obvious. I felt like I stumbled into a mystery bizarro-verse where you get dignity by default. It was SO WEIRD.

It's fucked up that being interested in this random programming language, not even for the reasons the fangirls love it, suddenly caused everyone to start being nice to me when I'm in fact the same trash can that I've been all along. Coming upon the Correct Signal by accident made it all feel extra wrong and extra strange, like I killed a man and wore his skin for a suit and suddenly inherited all the achievements ever made in that body.

I know railing against signaling is itself a signal that I am a naive member of society who has yet to smash out of my youthful optimism chrysalis into the apathetic reality machine. Signaling is going to be there no matter what, because human nature. All I can do is reflect in stupid amazement at this experience and compel you to treat others with respect by default. Seriously.
