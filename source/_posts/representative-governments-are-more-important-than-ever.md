Sometimes I think about how many YEARS of schooling and discourse with friends and experts and self-studying it took me to read and understand the context of 1 sentence about science and I am filled with a huge amount of dread that the gap between the total amount of human knowledge and the amount of time a person has in this life for a sufficient overview to have a legit opinion is exploding out of control and we can never ever depend on referendums ever because individuals don't and can't have the time to know enough to decide everything (or maybe even anything).
